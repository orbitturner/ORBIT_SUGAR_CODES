# humanize-calculator

Converts any math expression to words like "234/-7=0" > "two hundred and thirty-four divided by minus seven equals zero". 
As you see it doesn't check the correctness. 

Of course I could use num2words library to make my life easier. Butâ€¦I chose another way and wrote my own conversion algorythm.
Each number is converted EXACTLY as in num2words python library.

Input info:
1) you can use digits and operations '+', '-', '*', '/', '=' only
2) spaces are ignored ("424    535" > |"424535"| > "four hundred and twenty-four thousand, five hundred and thirty-five")
3) invalid when there are two consecutive operation signs ("47 +- 9" > "input error") 
BUT! The following combinations are ok: "=-", "*-", "/-", "=+", "*+", "/+". 
4) cannot begin with '=', '/' and '*'
5) cannot end with an operation
6) maximum number length is 33 but you can change it buy adding another "-illion" to the illions list in digits_library.py
